This environment was designed to assist students of the ML track offered by LOI.

## Getting Started

For some background and motivation as to why the given tools are used, see the
following links:

 - :information_source: [Vagrant: Getting Started](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/index.html)

Vagrant will manage our VirtualBox environments, as such one will need to
install both Vagrant and Virtualbox :wink:

> Packer is used to build the Vagrant boxes. You really don't need to be concerned about this part of the toolset, however; if curious there are some compelling [reasons](https://www.packer.io/intro/why.html) for using Packer.
